It was 4:30  when I put down my laptop opened my window and in a deep sigh felt the mild-cool breeze that blew from the steadily 
yellowing horizon. Mathematicians from CMU Had published a highly influential paper in Computational game theory my mind was filled
with possible extensions and generalizations of it. I considered some really mindbending approaches,some simple and some more rigorous
. Today in my hour reading session I was rereading Author Huxley's Brave New World and also trying to read  Vladimir Nabokov's 
Loita in Original Russian to improve my language and one line struck me along the day:Я достаточно горжусь тем, что знаю что-то скромное
о том, что я не знаю всех.With me chanting hymns from the Bhagavad Gita and doing Sudarshan Kriya I started my day! My happiness
was boundless, something way different and something fresh: Today I was going to Ekta's house to Vadodara -It was something I
looked forward to days now.Wow! ...just WOOOOOW! Completing my Sudarshan Kriya, I with a lot less effort today descended the 
stairs in my usual thoughtful mood. With the Excitement of what has to come gently supplying happiness and a sense of satisfaction 
from within. I brushed my teeth, took blessings of mom, took bath, texted Rushvi, had a video call with Susan, I wanted to
call Ekta but couldn't as I realized her last message was at 3:49 which means she was sleeping. Planning the trip timing 
with Hardik I made sure that I am late to catch the college bus. So that pappa could drop me till the bus stop enabling me 
to have that of 5 min conversation we could have today. 
I was so excited for I had to go.
