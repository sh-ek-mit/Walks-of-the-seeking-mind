Hi-Hii-Hiii-Hiiiii story.. :) 
I missed him a lot during my whole day....

I said I won't meet HIM when I'll go there..!
His discussion with mom about quality time, and her call, anger and consequences.

Shivam and her Janma kundali match making.. || Consequences || HIS LIFE-FUTURE-HAPPINESS-LOVE-WELBEING ||

My height of Frustration and rough rude mood.. || ANGER || DISSATISFACTION || NONSENSICAL MIND || USELESS DAY ||
HAPPY DAYS EFFECT UFFFFFF || EMOTIONS-LOVE-ANGER || MOOD SWINGS ||

Discussed with him about my exceptional talks with "AP" and "Rushabh".
And I was feeling satisfied from the depth of my heart.
I was wondering the way my smile is turning into "That charm I always wanted to admire".

First time I felt that thread in ME ! First time I had a instict of real happiness about m "Marriage" <3 
.......................
.....Will be filled.....
.......................
I expressed him all, with my heart blooming-lips smiling-face blushing.. :)
He was also so happy, told me to enjoy rhis phase without being judgemental.

We talked on "AGE","Marriage","It's Reflections"....

What would be situations after 2 years.. 
|| LOVE || MARRIAGE || HIS LIFE || MY LIFE || HIS DREAMS,EDUCATIONS || MY DREAMS,EDUCATION || POTENTIAL ||
|| All the things we are starting now how they would be after 2 years.. DIARY, BLOG, COLLABORATIONS, RESEARCH WORK, OUR ULTIMATE RANDOM TALKS||
|| WE || || US TOGETHER|| OUR BOND || OUR LOVE ||

I said, about in which circle he is included ! I didn't eant to include him there ever !
But those four days of our friendship to turn into "Best Friends"..
And these four days of my Happy Days to turn into "I will always stay here only you go or stay-hurt or love-Be there or not"... 
It's so special and utmost deep, but I didn't want it to happen, I didn't eant to trust him upto this extent !! But there is no "UNDO"
in Me !!! I broke my rule, my many things today for him !! :( And so, I made myself most vulnerable to him.. I decided that,
"I have enough best GEMS in my life, I don't need anyone new.. I can't take any risk of life ! And now except my husband I will not allow
anyone anymore in my life at all in this circle, no matter what." 
:) I'm so happy.. And I know it's the Best and deserves this from ME. But I really wish we shouldn't have these four days in this way ! :(


Told him the story of my side in so brief.. Since the day we met in Nirma..
I realised, I was dyingly waiting for the most special happening with me in NIRMA; and it happened to ME was: "SHIVAM".
How much luckiest I was feeling, ohh..!

|| I had never ever met sch a person, with whom I could feel this much inclusive! || He said he had never got such person " ... " ||
|| There is barely any rare matter upon which we might disagree..! ||
|| Either he or me always broadden up our perceptions || OR Plant some greatest seeds in OUR minds || I really wonder Is it!? ||
It takes huge "Sadhana" to get allignment in one's "Mind-Body-Energies"...! ----> gives Immense potential
How someone can be so alligned with the other effortlessly !???!? ----->> two such sets alligned, think of possibilites..!

I said to my Best Friend: "MIT" ! And he gave me wings to fly and insights of depth.
I saw that aspect in me which I always wanted to grow in me since my childhood ! 
Children might think about dreams so randomly "Doc,Eng,Pilot and blah blah.." without even having any insights.
I used to think, "Scientist" with utmost deepth. Will Continue this topic in my diary.

|| My MTECH || Opportunities in NIRMA || Setup he has done for me in NIRMA || 

I couldn't even realise how time flew away and I was just so deeply lost in most special talk with him. 
His meeting was at 1.30 but it was already 1.45, he was listening to me and talking to me... 

We had a long tight yet comfortable virtual yet real hug... .... 
... .... ... ....
I asked, "To hu jau ?" He asked kya? Mari duniya ma I said. .... 
..... .... ... .... ...
Chalo ne tamari duniya ma lai jaao ne mane.... 
.... ... ... ... ... ...
***Meeting Place****..... "I will meet you there." || MY SILENCE || Bas have na bolo kai jj..!!! ||
Chalo Chalo, tame kam patavo and jaldi sui jao.. Hu pan sui jau..

I went to get water and then in that peaceful, graceful mysterious night under deep dark sky, ekdum Rim zim Baarish.. 
"HAD A SHORT YET DEEP CONVERSATION WITH ME-NATURE-SKY-BAARISH-OM" Blessed him and went to sleeeeep.

I never knew I would have all these with a GUY-2ndYearBTech-MyBestFriend-ShivamPatel !! || **** Speechless ****
