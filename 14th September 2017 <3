My height of Frustration and rough rude mood.
Discussed with him about my exceptional talks with "AP" and "Rushabh".
And I was feeling satisfied from the depth of my heart.
I was wondering the way my smile is turning into "That charm I always wanted to admire".

First time I felt that thread in ME ! First time I had a instict of real happiness about m "Marriage" <3 
.......................
.....Will be filled.....
.......................
I expressed him all, with my heart blooming-lips smiling-face blushing.. :)
He was also so happy, told me to enjoy rhis phase without being judgemental.

We talked on "AGE","Marriage","It's Reflections"....

What would be situations after 2 years.. 
|| LOVE || MARRIAGE || HIS LIFE || MY LIFE || HIS DREAMS,EDUCATIONS || MY DREAMS,EDUCATION || POTENTIAL ||
|| All the things we are starting now how they would be after 2 years.. DIARY, BLOG, COLLABORATIONS, RESEARCH WORK, OUR ULTIMATE RANDOM TALKS||
|| WE || || US TOGETHER|| OUR BOND || OUR LOVE ||

Told him the story of my side in so brief.. Since the day we met in Nirma..
I realised, I was dyingly waiting for the most special happening with me in NIRMA; and it happened to ME was: "SHIVAM".
How much luckiest I was feeling, ohh..!

I said to my Best Friend: "MIT" ! And he gave me wings to fly and insights of depth.
I saw that aspect in me which I always wanted to grow in me since my childhood ! 
Children might think about dreams so randomly "Doc,Eng,Pilot and blah blah.." without even having any insights.
I used to think, "Scientist" with utmost deepth. Will Continue this topic in my diary.

|| My MTECH || Opportunities in NIRMA || Setup he has done for me in NIRMA || 

I couldn't even realise how time flew away and I was just so deeply lost in most special talk with him. 
His meeting was at 1.30 but it was already 1.45, he was listening to me and talking to me... 
Meeting Place..... "I will meet you there."

We had a long tight yet comfortable virtual yet real hug... .... ... .... ... ....
I asked, "To hu jau ?" He asked kya? Mari duniya ma I said. .... ..... .... ... .... ...
Chalo ne tamari duniya ma lai jaao ne mane.... .... ... ... ... ... ...
Chalo Chalo, tame kam patavo and jaldi sui jao.. Hu pan sui jau..
