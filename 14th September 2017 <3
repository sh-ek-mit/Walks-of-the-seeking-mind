Hi-Hii-Hiii-Hiiiii story.. :) 
I missed him a lot during my whole day....

I said I won't meet HIM when I'll go there..!
His discussion with mom about quality time, and her call, anger and consequences.

Shivam and her Janma kundali match making.. || Consequences || HIS LIFE-FUTURE-HAPPINESS-LOVE-WELBEING ||

My height of Frustration and rough rude mood.. || ANGER || DISSATISFACTION || NONSENSICAL MIND || USELESS DAY ||
HAPPY DAYS EFFECT UFFFFFF || EMOTIONS-LOVE-ANGER || MOOD SWINGS ||

Discussed with him about my exceptional talks with "AP" and "Rushabh".
And I was feeling satisfied from the depth of my heart.
I was wondering the way my smile is turning into "That charm I always wanted to admire".

First time I felt that thread in ME ! First time I had a instict of real happiness about m "Marriage" <3 
.......................
.....Will be filled.....
.......................
I expressed him all, with my heart blooming-lips smiling-face blushing.. :)
He was also so happy, told me to enjoy rhis phase without being judgemental.
|| Seeker || Genrealise || Global ||

We talked on "AGE","Marriage","It's Reflections"....

What would be situations after 2 years.. 
|| LOVE || MARRIAGE || HIS LIFE || MY LIFE || HIS DREAMS,EDUCATIONS || MY DREAMS,EDUCATION || POTENTIAL ||
|| All the things we are starting now how they would be after 2 years.. DIARY, BLOG, COLLABORATIONS, RESEARCH WORK, OUR ULTIMATE RANDOM TALKS||
|| WE || || US TOGETHER|| OUR BOND || OUR LOVE ||

I said, about in which circle he is included ! I didn't want to include him there ever !
But as those four days of our friendship to turn into "Best Friends"..
And these four days of my Happy Days to turn into "I will always stay here only you go or stay-hurt or love-Be there or not"... 
It's so special and utmost deep, but I didn't want it to happen, I didn't want to trust him upto this extent !! But there is no "UNDO" mechanism
in Me !!! I broke my rules and my many things got compromised today for him !! :( And so, I made myself most vulnerable to him.. I decided that,
"I have enough best GEMS in my life, I don't need anyone new.. I can't take any risk of life ! And now except my husband I will not allow
anyone anymore in my life at all in this circle, no matter what." 
:)Though I'm so happy.. And I know he deserves this from ME. But I really wish we shouldn't have had these four days in this way ! :(


Told him the story of my side in so brief.. Since the day we met in Nirma..
I realised, I was dyingly waiting for the most special happening with me in NIRMA; and it happened to ME was: "SHIVAM".
How much luckiest I was feeling, ohh..!

He told me stroies of his Papa and Dada.. || STIMULUS || ANIMAL LOVE || FAMILY VALUES || TIME TO SPEND WITH CHILDREN ||
I know he will be the Best father ever, his children will be lucky in all terms for sure... <3 I will love them too...... 

|| I had never ever met sch a person, with whom I could feel this much inclusive! || He said he had never got such person " ... " ||
|| There is barely any rare matter upon which we might disagree..! || I have started loving being with him ! ||
It takes huge "Sadhana" to get allignment in one's "Mind-Body-Energies"...! ----> gives Immense potential
How someone can be so alligned with the other one such effortlessly !???!? ----->> two such sets alligned, think of possibilites..!

When we talk for hours and hours,,
|| Either he or me always broaden up our perspectives || OR Plant some greatest seeds in OUR minds || Expand our experience Boundries ||
|| I really wonder Is it really true, meeting such people on this earth !? ||

I said to my Best Friend: "MIT" ! And he gave me wings to fly and insights of depth.
I saw that aspect in me which I always wanted to grow in me since my childhood ! 
Children might think about dreams so randomly "Doc,Eng,Pilot and blah blah.." without even having any insights.
I used to think, "Scientist" with utmost deepth. Will Continue this topic in my diary.

|| My MTECH || Opportunities in NIRMA || Setup he has done for me in NIRMA || 

I couldn't even realise how time flew away and I was just so deeply lost in most special talk with him. 
His meeting was at 1.30 but it was already 1.45, he was listening to me and talking to me... 

We had a long tight yet comfortable virtual yet real hug... .... 
... .... ... ....
I asked, "To hu jau ?" He asked kya? Mari duniya ma I said. .... 
..... .... ... .... ...
Chalo ne tamari duniya ma lai jaao ne mane.... 
.... ... ... ... ... ...
***Meeting Place****..... "I will meet you there." || MY SILENCE || Bas have na bolo kai jj..!!! ||
Chalo Chalo, tame kam patavo and jaldi sui jao.. Hu pan sui jau..

I went to get water and then in that peaceful, graceful mysterious night under deep dark sky, ekdum Rim zim Baarish.. 
"HAD A SHORT YET DEEP CONVERSATION WITH ME-NATURE-SKY-BAARISH-OM" Blessed him and went to sleeeeep.

I never knew I would have all these with a GUY-2ndYearBTech-MyBestFriend-ShivamPatel !! || **** Speechless ****

IT is some of the best one of the most mesimerising , beautiful and amazing  . These words held me deep down the depths of me ,
I felt i am writting this with wet eyes yet a braod smile on my face . It felt totally blissful to have a friend like she  and 
it wans't a onversation  but it was an experience all together .It broadened me , streched me , excited me ,educated me and in 
the true sense made me realize the feeling is in a way a thing so deep  so profound and profusing that I found that all logic and 
axiomatic fail to desribe it in its true glory .I realised that one must no doubt be facinated by what lies outside but the really
what matters is hwt lies inside of us.And realised quite deeply that ..the hugs were <3 <3 .
