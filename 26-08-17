The Theory of everything:
Affection and commitment:
  - Stephan Hawking's best ever smile: 
    Whatever the situation might be, the moment he get a bit good thing he gives a huge smile. Wow, I loved that one.
    It shows so many things like whatever the situations might be smile, and do what is right. Don't regret, don't feel miserable for the current situations
    instead make best out of everything with a big smile.
    His funda is same as Shivam, he always says "Smileee.." 
    
  - Jane's conscious decision and her dedication for her love:
    Yes it's the one of the best examples of affection and commitment. She took a conscious decision to fight along with her love and fulfil all his
    dreams together even knowing that he was sleeping towards death! But she believed, he can's pass away without achieving his goals and dreams,she
    loved him unconditionally. However worst situations were turning, she was always with him. She never did anything with feeling of regret or burden.
    She did all for him without any expectation in return. She alone took care of him, his family, her own PHD, his dreams, she stood like a strong rock.
    Hats off.! 
    As Shivam says always, "Nature manages it all, you never have to bag a support. Nature gives a support like a backbone to all such people they never need
    to ask for" seems to be so true.
    This also proves one more thing to me, "East or west "Love" is universal in it's raw and original form. It's boundless (Anhad), selfless, limitless(Aseem),
    truest, most beautiful than anything else in the world. And it's source is within you. Once it starts flowing, there is no way to stop it!! It
    will flow infinitely."    
 -  Keep fighting and nature will always support you, keep faith in yourself, keep seeking. One day you will reach there winning all the chellenges no
    mater what. 
 -  Limitless nature of a MIND.“Although I cannot move and I have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free.”
 -  I love this: “My goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all.”
 -  His last statement: Universe is boundless and so human endeavors are. We are all different. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do,
    and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope.
    And this amazes me because it exacly matches to what a Yogi:Sadhguru said. 
    One is Mystic, enlighten being and another is a scientist, physisist.
